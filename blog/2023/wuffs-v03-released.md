# Wuffs v0.3 Released

[Wuffs](https://github.com/google/wuffs) (a memory-safe programming language,
and a standard library written in that language) has just released version 0.3.

The headline feature is that we have a production quality PNG decoder. It's
also [the fastest, safest PNG decoder in the
world](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2021/fastest-safest-png-decoder.html).
There's also a [memory-safe, zero-allocation JSON
decoder](https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/jsonptr.html).

Wuffs' GIF decoder has shipped in the Google Chrome web browser [since June
2021](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2940044).
